###Description

This is a version of the FizzBuzz program, where the user enters a number, and all of the numbers leading up to that number are displayed on the page. Multiples of 3 are displayed as "Ping", multiples of 5 are displayed as "Pong", and multiples of 3 and displayed as "Ping-Pong." This app demonstrates my understanding of Java arrays, conditional statements and for loops.
